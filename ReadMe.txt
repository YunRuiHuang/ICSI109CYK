For the CYK program ï¼ˆthis is a early version of ReadMe, I will rewrite it when I submit)

The main class is the Driver.java, there are not thing need to input when start.
At the begin, the program would read the test.txt file to get the CFG* from the file.
(* the CFG language should write as  Obj1 -> XX|XX|XX,Obj2-> XX|XX  in file
   each row split by commat ',' 
   object and contect aplit by "->"
   each contect split by '|'
   Also, the program would only read the first line of file, please write all the CFG in one line)

When the program ready, It will print the CFG and ready for type in,
All kind of word is accept to type, but the char "E" will identify as empty
type in word quit can stop the program.
